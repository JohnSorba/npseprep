## What are Analogies?

**Analogies** are relationships of resemblance or equivalence between two situations, people, or objects, especially when used as a basis for an explanation.

Analogies can also be defined as words that are related or connected in one way or the other. For instance:
- **Shoes** are related to **leather** (shoes are made of leather)

# UNIT 3: Word Groups

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Comprehend what word groups are
- Answer questions on word groups correctly

## Main Points

**Word groups** means a group of words that belong to the same class. Therefore, the name of the group to which all the words belong is the general word. Thus, this unit is intended to test the ability of candidates to determine the general word group of a series of words given.

A **group** is a number of things or persons that are in some kind of relation to one another. It is also a number of people or things that are located, gathered or classed together.

### Examples:

- **blue, green, pink, red, and yellow** belong to the general group name called **COLOUR**.
- **father, mother, sisters and brothers** are called **FAMILY** because they are a group of people who live and do many things in common.

In the NPSE examinations, this type of unit is visibly seen in **Section Two**.

## Instructions

In each of the following groups of words, pick out the one word that does not belong to the group.

### Example:

A. tea  
B. beer  
C. coffee  
D. cocoa  
E. Ovaltine

**Answer:** The word **beer** does not belong to the group. Answer space **B** would be shaded.

**Explanation:** Beer is not part of the group because it is an alcoholic beverage whereas all the other options belong to a group known as non-alcoholic beverages.

# UNIT 5: Sentence Arrangement

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Demonstrate clear comprehension on the meaning of a sentence
- Arrange sentences in their correct sequence or order of occurrence

## Main Points

A **sentence** is a grammatically complete series of words consisting of a subject and predicate even if one or the other is implied, and typically beginning with a capital letter and ending with a full stop.

1. It is also a group of words that make a complete sense or thought.
2. **Arrangement** simply means the act of arranging, the manner of being arranged.
3. A collection of things that have been arranged accordingly.
4. It is also a particular way in which items are organized.

### Three Main Types of Sentences:

# UNIT 6: Word Patterns 1

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Form a second word by adding or subtracting a letter from the first word
- Observe the words carefully in order to be able to identify the relationships between pairs of words and answer the questions correctly

## Main Points

This exercise requires a careful observation of two pairs of words. Try to find out how the pairs of words are related and then find out a word from the options which is related to the other word which does not have a pair.

Candidates are required to do a careful observation in order to identify the relationship that exists between different pairs of words. They can do so either by:
- Adding or subtracting the first letter of the first
- Writing the first in complete reversal
- Omitting a few letters from the first word given in each pair

This type of question always appears in **Section Three**.

## Instructions

In each of the following questions, you are given two pairs of words and then a fifth word followed by a gap. Look carefully at the two words in each pair and find out how they are related. Then choose from the five words lettered A - E the word which is related to the fifth word in the same way.

### Example:

**bin, big; pin, pig; ran ……..…**

A. run  
B. rot  
C. rang  
D. rain  
E. rag

**Answer:** In this example, the second word of each pair of the words is obtained by replacing the letter **'n'** of the first word with the letter **'g'**. Therefore the correct answer is **rag** which is lettered **'E'**.

# UNIT 7: Word Pattern Review

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Do more practice on Word Patterns in order to put them in a better position
- Create different word patterns on their own

## Main Points

Since the word pattern takes various forms to create a new word from the first word, it is necessary to have another unit to exhaust all the different forms of word pattern and enable the candidates to do well in their exams.

This is because there is no specific rule to follow in order to do well in this particular topic. The most important thing here is for the candidate to carefully observe the example and find out the relationship that exists between the pairs of words that form the first two pairs and then use that to answer the question that follows.

## Instructions

In each of the following questions, there are two pairs of words and then a fifth word followed by a gap. Look carefully at the two words in each pair and find out how they are related. Then choose from the five words lettered A–E, the word which is related to the fifth word in the same way.

### Example:

**eel, peels; rate, prates; late, ………….**

A. plaits  
B. prates  
C. planes  
D. plates  
E. plains

**Answer:** In this example, the second word of each pair is obtained by adding first and last letters to the first word. The correct answer therefore is **plates** and therefore answer space **'D'** would be shaded.

# UNIT 8: Word Making

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of his lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Use a single letter to make two words using it to begin the one word and end the other words

## Main Points

This particular unit appears to be found in **Section VII** Verbal Aptitude test (NPSE). In this unit, the candidates are given two incomplete words in which the last letter of the first letter as well as the first letter of the second is missing.

The candidates are therefore expected to choose the letter that will end the first word and begin the second word.

In this unit, brackets will be introduced between both words to indicate the fact that there is a missing letter that relates to both words. This is important for the pupils because it helps to improve their vocabulary. Their ability to find a single letter that ends and completes two different words go a long way to contribute to their academic performance.

## Instructions

In each of the following questions, there are two incomplete words. Choose from the letters labelled A - E the one that can end the first and begin the second.

### Example:

**com ( ) ook**

A. p  
B. d  
C. b  
D. k  
E. c

- Look at a group of words and pick out the words that are not formed with the same letters as the others

## Main Points

**Word building** is vocabulary development. This topic requires the candidates to form several words out of just one word. This particular topic if properly practiced helps the pupils to have a wealth of vocabulary in their daily use of the English Language and therefore resulting in a good performance in their exams.

### Examples:

**READ** = dear, dare  
**RATE** = tear, tare

## Instructions

All the words except one in each of the questions 1 − 4 are formed with the same letters. Choose the word that is not formed with the same letters as the other four.

### Question 1

# UNIT 12: Reading Comprehension

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Learn how to spell and pronounce a variety of words
- Form the habit of reading junior readers
- Take note of new and difficult words and learn their meanings

## Personal Reading Experience

When I was in the primary school, my favourite reader books were; "Pa Demba's Heir" and "The Kamara family". When I went to the secondary school, my favourite book was "Jeneba and the Road". During those years, reading was a real pleasure to me and I learnt lots of new things. From that time, I developed a reading habit and read several books at different stages of my education. At the moment, I am close to finishing a book titled "As a Man Thinketh", by James Allen.

**Questions to Consider:**
- What supplementary books are you reading now?
- Can you share you experiences or new ideas you have learnt by reading the books?

## Main Points to Remember

It will be very difficult for anyone to read and understand a given passage if he/she cannot spell or pronounce the words that make up the sentences correctly. Therefore, one's success in reading comprehension depends on how much vocabulary he/she has.

So teachers as well as pupils are encouraged to learn the spelling and pronunciation as well as the meaning of several words.

## How Do I Learn to Spell and Pronounce Words Well?

The easiest way to spell, pronounce and improve understanding is by **reading a book**. As such, ask your parents to get you good reading books or go to your library to borrow good reading books and read them.

To test the level of your understanding, try to explain the content of the books you have read to your parents, friends and school mates.

### Steps to Improve Reading:

1. As you read each book, make sure you **underline all the new and difficult words** you come across
2. Try not to skip any word because you cannot pronounce it properly
3. Ask a family member or a friend to help you with both the **meaning and pronunciation** of the difficult words
4. Write them in your note book for further reference and practice purposes

That is one of the best ways to learn how to spell and pronounce new and difficult words thereby improving your ability to read.

## Activity

**Question:** What can you do in order to spell and pronounce words properly?

From the notes on how to learn spellings and pronunciation of difficult and new words, there are a few words that you might not be able to spell or pronounce well and they are underlined for special attention.

**Difficult Words:** pronounce, pronunciation, improve, understanding, parent, interesting, narrate, and difficult.

Please ask a senior family member to help you sound these words, spell them and help you with their meanings.

## Recap

Follow the same patterns above to improve your reading comprehension knowledge and skills by:

- Reading junior supplementary books
- Taking note of new and difficult words
- Writing the new and difficult words in a note book
- Trying as much as possible to pronounce and spell them correctly
- Learning the meanings of the new and difficult words

## Main Points

**Alphabetical order** is a system whereby character strings are placed in an order, based on the position of the characters in the conventional ordering of an alphabet. It is one of the methods of collation.

Thus, in order to determine which two strings of characters come first when arranging in alphabetical order, their first letters are compared.

### Rules:

- If the first letters are **different**, then the string whose first letter comes earlier in the alphabet comes before the other string
- If the first letters are the **same**, then the second letters are compared, and so on
- If a position is reached where one string has no more letters to compare, while the other does, then the first (shorter) string is deemed to come first in alphabetical order

## Instructions

In each of the following questions you are given a list of words, lettered A–E. Work out the alphabetical position of each word as directed, and write the letter of the correct answer.

### Example:

**Which word comes first in the dictionary?**

# UNIT 21: Word Making

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Make several words from one capitalised word by adding a prefix or suffix to the root word

## Main Points

Most English words are derived from other words and that can happen either by adding a **prefix** or **suffix** to the root word to make a new word. Therefore, understanding the meaning of a root word can be of great help to the pupils to find the meaning of new words that were developed.

A **root word** therefore is a word or part of a word that can form the basis of new words as one comes across them. Therefore, it is good to know that most of the words that we use in our daily conversation come from the root word. So, whenever you remove the prefix or suffix, it is the root that remains.

### Examples:

#### Root + Suffix = Final New Word

| ROOT | SUFFIX | FINAL NEW WORD |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Act | -ing | acting |
| Pain | -ful | painful |
| Serious | -ly | seriously |
| Pray | -er | prayer |
| Danger | -ous | dangerous |

#### Prefix + Root = Final New Word

| PREFIX | ROOT | FINAL NEW WORD |
|--------|------|----------------|
| Pre- | paid | prepaid |
| De- | code | decode |
| Ex- | wife | ex-wife |
| Il- | legal | illegal |

# UNIT 23: Synonyms

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Develop an understanding of words that have the same meaning with other words
- Explain what synonyms are

## Main Points

If you want to be fluent in English, you must improve upon your vocabulary. One way to do so is through synonyms.

### What are Synonyms?

**Synonyms** are words that have similar or the same meanings. This unit is important as it would enable the pupils to be familiar with most of the words that people use in expressing themselves.

Being familiar with words from the dictionary would enable them to be good speakers and listeners and be able to analyse and interpret difficult words spoken by people.

**Example:** scared, petrified, afraid, terrified are all synonymous words as they mean the same or similar things.

Thus, you can increase your ability to communicate if you have many words in mind that can be used to express the same meaning.

## Examples of Synonyms

| Word | Synonym |
|------|---------|
| Hero | champion |
| Success | achievement |
| Greetings | salutation |
| Debate | argument |
| Award | prize |
| Have | beget, acquire, possess |
| Plan | design, procedure, plot |
| Destiny | rupture, smash, demolish |
| Keep | hold, retain, withhold, sustain |
| Fall | descend, tumble, drop |
| Go | depart, disappear, fade, move, proceed |
| Run | dash, escape, elope, hasten, hurry, speed |
| Hide | conceal, cover, mask, cloak, camouflage, screen |
| Move | go, creep, crawl, inch, poke, drag |
| Use | employ, utilise, exhaust, spend, expend, consume |

## Recap

1. Come: ……………, ………………, …………………

2. Create: ………….., ………………, …………………

3. Beautiful: ……………., …………………, ………….

4. Develop; ………………, ……………….., ……………

5. True ; …………………., …………………….,

# UNIT 24: Antonyms

## Learning Outcome

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Build on their vocabulary by giving the opposite word for several words and their meanings

## Main Points

This topic is very important for the pupils as it will help them build on their vocabulary that helps them speak, read and write good English.

**Antonyms** are words that are opposite in meaning to another word. The word **opposite** means not the same.

For instance:
- The opposite of **bad** is **good**
- The opposite of **absent** is **present**

The words and their opposite words as given in the examples will definitely give you different meanings. Therefore, knowing more words and their meanings will be of great help to pupils as it will help them grow their vocabulary.

## Examples of Antonyms

| Word | Antonym |
|------|---------|
| Agree | disagree |
| Appear | disappear |
| Decent | indecent |
| Lead | mislead |
| Admit | deny |
| cheap | expensive |
| below | above |
| under | on top |
| sense | nonsense |
| able | unable |

## Activity

Give the antonyms of the following words:

| Word | Antonym |
|------|---------|

# UNIT 25: Code and Decoding

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Learn how to read through codes with letters and numbers
- Associate codes with their appropriate numbers to figure out the required answer

## Main Points

**Codes** consist of letters and numbers that have a secret meaning.

The military for example, uses lots of codes as a symbol for many things that can only be understood by them. Also, computer programmers use codes to come up with the many applications that are installed in phones and computers.

For your level, we are going to look at what is relevant for you in the exams.

### Example Calculation:

If you are asked to add 5462 + 2564, how would you go about it? Try to arrange it in your note book as you usually do, such as:

```
 5462
+2564
-----
```

Did you observe that the second set of numbers are placed at the bottom of the first set in order to make the calculation easier for you? This skill is very necessary for codes and decoding.

### Example:

If the vowels; **a, e, i, o, u** stand for **BOATS**; **BATS** will be **a, i, o, u**.

**How did we arrive at A, I, O, U?**

We arrange the vowels and BOATS in perfect order just like this:

```
A E I O U
B O A T S
```

Then we look at the vowels that tally with **BATS** which are in bold **(a, i, o, u)**.

Do you notice that the vowel **'E'** is missing? Can you guess the reason?

## Instructions

The words below are written in certain CODES. Study each word and its codes carefully and work out the codes to answer the questions below.

### Example:

The word **CUPBOARD** represents the number **38625174**, what numbers represent the word **BROAD**?

A. 27543  
B. 27542  
C. 27541  
D. 27514  
E. 27513

**Answer:** The answer for this question is **27514** which is **D**.

# UNIT 26: Revision of Sentence Arrangement

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, the pupils will be able to:
- Get clear comprehension on the meaning of a sentence
- Be able to arrange sentences in their correct sequence or order of occurrence

## Main Points

A **sentence** is a grammatically complete series of words consisting of a subject and a predicate, even if one or the other is implied. It typically begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop.

1. It is also a group of words that make a complete sense or thought.
2. **Arrangement** simply means the act of arranging, the manner of being arranged, and a collection of things that have been arranged.
3. It is also a particular way in which items are organised.

### Three Main Types of Sentences:

1. **Simple sentence:** A simple sentence has a subject and a verb.
2. **Compound sentence:** Is made up of two simple sentences joined by 'and' or 'but' and 'so', for example.

It is important to note that sentence arrangement appears in **Section V** of this paper and pupils will be expected to see three numbered simple sentences and be asked to arrange them in order of occurrence.

## Example:

1. Leave it to boil.
2. Put the kettle on the fire.

- Determine and pick a general name for a group of words

## Main Points

A **general term** is a word used for a group of people or things that are brought together by chance or by design.

**Group** is a number of things or persons being in some relation to one another. It is also a number of people or things that are located, gathered or classified together.

### Examples:

- **blue, green, pink, red, yellow** are all colours; therefore, they are a group of colours
- **father, mother, sisters, and brothers** are called **family**, because they are a group of people who live and work together and do many things in common

In the NPSE examination, this type of unit is visibly seen in **Section Two**.
