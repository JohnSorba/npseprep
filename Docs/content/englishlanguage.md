# UNIT 5: Pronouns

## What are Pronouns?

Pronouns are words used to replace nouns.

**Examples:**
- When Moses gave me the money, he told me to go and see a medical doctor. (The pronoun **he** takes the place of the noun Moses).
- Adama and Mabel are best of friends. They are attending the King Fahad Primary School. (The pronoun **they** takes the place of the nouns Adama and Mabel.)

**Examples of pronouns:** He, she, it, him, his, they, I, we, their and so on

## Types of Pronouns

### Personal Pronoun

This refers to a specific person, place, thing or idea by showing:
- The person speaking (first person)
- The person being spoken to (second person)
- Any other person, place or thing being talked about (third person)

**Examples:** I, me, we, us, you, he, him, she, her, it, they, them

- We will keep the money with us.
- I will see you tomorrow.
- They are in their car

### Possessive Pronouns

These take the place of possessive forms of nouns.

**Examples:** my, mine, our, ours, your, yours, his, theirs, her, hers, its

- Is that her book?
- It's my mother's cat. (contraction for it is)
- The cat was eating its food. (possessive pronoun)
- My book has been stolen.

### Demonstrative Pronouns

These are pronouns that point out specific persons, places, things or ideas.

**Examples:** this, that, these, those

- This is your new ball.
- Let me do that for you.
- Are these the boys you are talking about?
- Those are my brothers.

# UNIT 6: Functions of Pronouns

## Interrogative Pronoun

This is used to ask questions.

**Examples:** Who, Whom, What, Where

- Who took the book?
- Whom did you give the pen?
- What is your name?
- Where are you going?

## Relative Pronoun

This is used to begin a special subject-verb word group called a subordinate clause.

**Examples:** Who, Whom, Whoever, Whomever, Whichever, Which, Whose, Whatever, That, What

- I saw the man, who gave me money to pay my debt.
- The book that he wrote is the best.
- Whoever came late to school will be sent back home.
- The boy, whom I told you about, has gone to America.

## Indefinite Pronouns

These refer to a person, place, thing, or an idea in a more general way than a noun does.

**Examples:**
- Do you know anyone in your class? (The indefinite pronoun **anyone** does not refer to a specific person).
- Several boys have gone to Libya. (The indefinite pronoun **several** does not refer to a specific group of people.)

**Examples of indefinite pronouns:** all, another, any, anybody, anyone, anything, both, each, either, enough, everybody, everyone, few, many, most, much, neither, nobody, none, no one, nothing, one, other, several, some, something.

# UNIT 7: Verbs

## What are Verbs?

A verb is a word or group of words that denotes an action or a state of being (experience).

**Examples:**
- Mary is reading her book. (Reading here is the main verb.)
- Abdulai was late for school. (Here, was is the verb.)

Words such as: look, think, study, see, work, walk, take, are all verbs.

## Types of Verbs

### Regular Verbs

These are verbs whose past and past participle are formed by either adding **d** or **ed** to the base or root word.

**Examples:**
- dance - danced
- play - played
- carry - carried
- mix - mixed
- kill - killed
- arrive - arrived

### Irregular Verbs

These are verbs whose past and past participle are formed differently.

**Examples:**
- Begin → began → begun

- Blow → blew → blown
- Choose → chose → chosen
- Fly → flew → flown

### Activities

# UNIT 8: Subject-Verb Agreement

## What is Subject-Verb Agreement?

Subject-Verb Agreement means, the subject in a sentence must agree with the verb to make a complete thought. The subject in a sentence can either be a noun or a pronoun. The verb in a sentence is the action or state of being in a sentence.

**The rule:** If the subject is singular, the verb must be singular. If the subject is plural, the verb should also be plural.

**Examples:**
- Mary plays volleyball for the team. (Here the subject Mary is singular and the verb plays is also singular.)
- John and Mary are in school. (Here the subjects John and Mary are plural, so the verb are is also plural.)

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Fill in the correct verbs to agree with the different subjects in the following sentences.

1. Eating and talking ——— bad habit. (is, are)
2. The list of items ——— on the desk. (is, were)

# UNIT 9: Verb Tenses

Tenses play an important role in English Language. They denote the time an action takes place, whether sometimes in the present, past or future.

## Types of Verb Tenses

### Simple Present Tense

This is used to talk about general facts, repeated action, wishes and emotions.

**Examples:**
- I live at Wellington.
- Kadiatu plays volleyball for the School. (Note: the third person singular always takes an S. Play therefore takes an S = plays.)
- Mosquitoes suck blood. (In this case, since the third person is plural, it does not take an S = suck.)
- The sun shines from the East.

### Present Continuous Tense

This talks about action that is taking place at the moment. This is formed by using the auxiliary verb 'to be' (is, am, are) with the main verb ending in **-ing**:

**Examples:**
- I am reading my notes.
- He is sleeping now.
- We are leaving the town.

### Present Perfect Tense

This is used to talk about past action for which time is not specific or important.

**Examples:**
- I have worn my suit three times.
- They have seen him.
- I have gone to Kailahun.
- I have washed my car.
- She has written a letter.

We form the present perfect tense by using the auxiliary verb **'has'** or **"have"** with a past participle (which usually ends with **'ed'** or **'en'**).

### Present Perfect Continuous Tense

This is used to show an action that began in the past but is still ongoing.

**Examples:**
- He has been talking for an hour.
- We have been playing football.
- She has been eating since this morning.

We form the present perfect continuous tense by using **have/has + been + verb + ing**.

**Example:** I have been dancing.

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Fill the table below with the correct tense:

| Simple present | Present continuous | Present perfect | Present perfect continuous |
|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Amid drinks tea everyday | | | |

| They buy onions every weekend | | | |
| The sun shines everyday | | | |

# UNIT 10: Past Tense

## Simple Past Tense

This tense talks about an action that was completed in the past. With regular verbs, we form the simple past by adding **ed** or **d** to the root word.

**Examples:**
- climb → climbed
- Play → played
- dance → danced

Irregular verbs can take different forms.

**Examples:**
- Drink → drank
- Take → took
- Eat → ate
- Go → went
- Write → wrote

## Past Continuous Tense

This is used to indicate that an action took place during a certain period time. It is used to provide background details or imply an activity interrupted. We form this tense by using the past forms of the verb "to be" (was, were) with an **-ing** verb.

**Formula:** was + verb + ing or were + verb + ing

**Examples:**
- I was watching the show when it began to rain.
- We were eating when the news came about his award.
- I was sleeping when the snake entered the house.

## Past Perfect Tense

This is used to talk about something that had been completed before another past action. We form the past perfect tense by using the verb **'had'** with a past participle verb.

**Formula:** had + past perfect tense of a verb

**Examples:**
- I had written to the newspaper, but did not receive a reply.
- She had filed the paper work in the wrong folder.
- The school had sent me the money before the term ended.

## Past Perfect Continuous Tense

This tense talks about an action that began in the past and continued until at least another point in the past. It is used to show length of time in the past or reason for a past result. We form this tense by using **'had been'** with an **ing** verb.

**Formula:** Had + been + ing form of a verb

**Examples:**

**Length of time:** They had been living in Sierra Leone for four years.

**Reason for past result:** I had been struggling to keep up, so the manager took me out of the game.

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Complete the table below:

| Simple past | Past continuous | Past perfect | Past perfect continuous |

# UNIT 11: Future Tense

## Simple Future Tense

This tense talks about something that will happen (even if you do not know when it will happen).

**Examples:**
- We will complain.
- I shall complain.
- You will complain.
- They will come.
- She will eat.
- We shall play.

### Formation Method B

**Examples:**
- The house is going to collapse.
- The teacher is going to read us a story.
- We are going to eat our food.

## Future Continuous Tense

This talks about something that will happen at a specific time in the future.

We form the future continuous tense by using **'will be'** **'shall be'** + verb + **ing**.

**Examples:**
- I will be driving when the match starts.
- We shall be travelling by bus.
- You will be eating your breakfast in the morning.
- We will be walking when it starts to rain.

## Future Perfect Tense

This tense talks about an action that will happen before another future action. We form this tense by using **'will have'** with a past participle.

**Examples:**
- By the time you get here, I will have watched every show on the television.
- By the time you sit in the car, they will have eaten their food.
- By the time you brush your teeth, I will have completed my assignment.

## Future Perfect Continuous Tense

This tense talks about an action that begins in the future and continue till another point in the future. It emphasizes how long something will take place.

We form this tense by using **will/shall + have been + verb + ing**.

**Examples:**
- They will have been drinking water for 30 days by the time they break their fast.
- I will have been playing football for one month by the time school reopens.
- We will have been eating only by the time we get there.

# UNIT 21: Composition/Essay Writing

## What is a Composition/Essay Writing?

A composition or an essay is an integral part of the study of English. It is a piece of writing that describes/narrates a person/place or a thing.

## How to Write a Composition

If you want to excel in reading and writing good English Composition, there are basic aspects of the English Language you ought to learn. Effective planning gives the right direction. Planning is very important for preparing a great composition. It helps you to organise your thoughts, control your writing process, motivates you to write better and faster, and keeps you on track.

### The 5Ws and 1H Questions

In preparation to write your composition you need to answer:

1. **Who** is the main character of your story?
2. **Where** do the events take place?
3. **When** do they happen?
4. **What** happens?
5. **Why** did they occur?
6. **How** was everything solved?

After answering these questions and identifying the main purpose of your composition (to inform, persuade, entertain, and call attention to something) you can proceed to write a simple composition.

## A Typical Common Composition Structure

A composition in English Language consists of:

1. **Heading**
2. **Introduction**
3. **Main Body**
4. **Conclusion**

### Headings

When choosing a title for your composition make sure it relates to the present content. Keep your heading short to grab the reader's attention at once. A good title can range from two to several words. It is recommended not to use a heading that is long and complex.

**Examples:**
- MY FIRST DAY IN SCHOOL
- MY BEST FRIEND

### Introduction

Following the heading is the introductory paragraph. It leads the reader to find out what your composition is about and makes him/her follow to the main part.

**Make sure that your introduction:**
- Is interesting enough to get the reader's attention
- Prepares your reader for what is to follow
- Lets your reader know what your composition will be about
- Is clear and not too long

If your introduction fails to catch the reader's attention, then you have not done a good job. Include a dialogue, amazing facts, shocking information or a joke to grab the reader's interest.

### Main Body

After the introductory paragraph make a smooth transition to the main part of your composition. This is the part where the main story develops. A good body should support the statement you have made in your introduction. It is where you express your feelings, thought and ideas on a particular topic.

**While writing, keep the following in mind:**
- Write simple and short sentences for your reader to easily follow your thoughts
- Avoid complex structures and expression
- Use transitional words and phrases to connect the sentence and paragraphs
- Since the main body is the heart of your composition, state the main points consistently and reasonably

### Conclusion

The conclusion is the last but not least part of your composition. Never end your story abruptly, take time to conclude your work beautifully. Your conclusion should be a summary of the main idea of your composition. Do not present new point and opinions.

## Important Things to Know About a Good Composition

1. Your writing should be straight to the point and sharp
2. Never use slang if it does not form part of the format of your composition
3. Do not use words you are not sure about
4. Keep your sentences short and not overwhelming
5. Take care to express a clear point of view

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Using the steps above, write a composition about your schools field trip.

# UNIT 22: Prefixes and Suffixes

## Prefix

A prefix is placed at the beginning of a word to modify or change its meaning. This is a list of the most common prefixes in English, together with their basic meanings and some examples.

**Note:** A prefix appears at the beginning of a word.

## Suffix

A suffix is seen at the end of a word. The origins of words are extremely complicated.

**Note:** This list does not include elements like "auto" or "bio" because these are "combining forms" not prefix.

### Examples of Prefixes

| Prefix | Root Word | New Word |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| Anti | biotic | Antibiotic |
| Anti | climax | Anticlimax |
| Dis | mount | Dismount |
| Dis | believe | Disbelieve |
| Anti | social | Antisocial |
| Dis | like | Dislike |
| Dis | agree | Disagree |
| Fore | cast | Forecast |
| Extra | curricular | Extracurricular |
| Extra | Ordinary | Extraordinary |
| For | ward | Forward |
| Fore | see | Foresee |
| Fore | most | Foremost |
| Fore | head | Forehead |
| In | correct | Incorrect |
| In | accurate | Inaccurate |
| In | ability | Inability |
| In | complete | Incomplete |
| Co | worker | Coworker |
| Co | pilot | Copilot |
| Co | operation | Cooperation |
| Co | exist | Coexist |
| Mis | fire | Misfire |
| Mis | take | Mistake |
| Mis | understand | Misunderstand |
| Mis | conduct | Misconduct |

# UNIT 23: Suffixes

## What are Suffixes?

Suffixes are letters that are added at the end of a stem to make new words. The suffixes used in the words are different from the prefixes used in the prefixed words, as they make different kinds of words.

"A suffix (also called ending) is an affix that is placed after the stem of a word."

**Example:**
- **Reader** = 'Read' + 'er'
- Read is the stem of the word which has a different meaning and a different grammatical function in a sentence but an affix "er" changes both the meaning and the grammatical function of the word to make a new word.

### Examples of Suffixes

| Root Word | Suffix | New Word |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Reading | | Player |
| Readable | | Trader |
| Creator | | Faithful |
| Creation | | Grateful |
| Pastor | | Happiness |
| Teacher | | Wickedness |
| Plumber | | Laziness |
| Hunter | | Quickly |
| Writer | | Badly |
| Singer | | Goodness |
| | | Peaceful |
| | | Gainful |
| | | Hopeful |
| | | Helpful |
| | | Bigger |
| | | Begger |
| | | Counter |
| | | Receiver |
| | | Sender |
| | | Better |
| | | Beautifully |
| | | Actor |
| | | Handle |
| | | Tailor |
| | | Guidance |
| | | Betrayal |
| | | Sickness |

**Note:** It is not necessary that a suffix changes the meaning and the grammatical property of the words. It can perform either of them. A suffix can make a word/stem of a word a noun, verb, adverb or adjective. A suffix can also make a transition in the degree of an adjective or in the tense of a verb.

### More Examples of Suffixes

| Root | Suffix | New Word |
|------|--------|----------|
| Confer | ence | Conference |
| National | ism | Nationalism |
| Place | ment | Placement |
| Sick | ness | Sickness |
| Active | ity | Activity |
| Employ | ee | Employee |

# UNIT 25: Homophones and Homonyms

## What are Homophones?

Two words might have the same pronunciation but different meanings. For example, the word "bare" sounds like "bear" but it is spelt differently and have different meanings.

These tricky words and many others like them are members of a group of words called homophones.

Homophones fall under the umbrella of the term homonym. Homophones are words that are pronounced the same (to varying extent) as another word but differ in meaning. Homophones may also differ in spelling as 'rose' (flower) 'rose' (past tense of "rise") or differently such as "to", "two" and "too".

The term "homophone" may also apply to units longer or shorter than words, such as phrases, letters or groups of letters which are pronounced the same as another phrase, letter or group of letters. Any unit with this property is said to be homophonous.

### Examples of Homophones

| Word 1 | Word 2 |
|--------|--------|
| Air | heir |

# UNIT 26: Convention of Spelling Using Conjugation

## Spelling Conventions

Modern English has been formed from and influenced by a variety of different Languages – Latin, Greek, French, German etc. In addition to its evolution from old and middle English, the ways in which words are spelt and created can often seem inconsistent, illogical and even contradictory. While there may be no single set of rules for English spelling, there are many different conventions and patterns we can use to help make it easy to grasp.

## Conjugation

Conjugation specifically refers to the inflection of verbs. In terms of spelling changes, it refers to changing a verb's structure to reflect past tense (as in walk – walked) continuous tense (as in walk – walking) or the third person singular (as in walk – walks).

Conjugation is the changing of a verb form to express a difference in person, number, tense, aspect, or gender.

In order to communicate in more than one tone, verbs must be conjugated. To conjugate something is to change the verb's form to express a different meaning.

### Conjugation Changes to Express:

- Person (subject)
- Number (singular or plural)
- Tense (past, present, future)
- Aspect (the degree to which the action is completed)
- Gender (male or female – in some languages but not in English)

Changing (or conjugating) a verb means taking it out of its infinitive base form and using it in the sentence appropriately. Verbs conjugated have various forms according to the different English verb tenses. Furthermore, English verb conjugation changes with regular and irregular verbs.

### How do you conjugate a verb?

**Example:**

**Verb (infinitive/base form):** to dance

**Simple present conjugation:**
- I dance
- You dance (singular and plural)
- He/she/it dances
- We dance
- They dance

## What Conjugated Verbs Communicate

A conjugated verb expresses several different concepts. This is why it is important to use proper conjugation. Improper conjugation is very confusing to an audience.

### How Verb Conjugation Affects Person

**Example of infinitive verb:** to cook

Consequently, changes in conjugation depending on the subject:
- I cook
- You cook (singular)
- He/she/it cooks
- We cook
- You cook (plural)
- They cook

### How Verb Conjugation Affects Numbers

Conjugated verb for "number" refers to whether the verb is used with a singular or plural subject. The appropriate conjugation needs to be used depending on:

**Singular:**
- I cook
- You cook
- He/she/it cooks

**Plural:**
- We cook
- You cook
- They cook

### How Verb Conjugation Affects Tenses

Three tenses exist in the English Language: present, past and future. Verbs are conjugated to express these tenses in which they occur.

#### Simple Present

For English verbs, the only change in the present simple tense is that an "S" is added to the end of the third person singular verb.

**Example:**
- I cook
- You cook (singular)
- He/she/it cooks
- We cook
- You cook (plural)
- They cook

#### Simple Past

For most English verbs, a "d" or "ed" is added to the base form to create the past tense.

- I cooked
- You cooked (singular)
- He/she/it cooked
- We cooked
- You cooked (plural)
- They cooked

#### Simple Future

For English verbs "will" is added between the subject and the base form of the verb to create the simple future tense.

- I will cook
- You will cook (singular)
- He/she/it will cook
- We will cook
- You will cook (plural)
- They will cook

### How Verb Conjugation Affects Aspects

The aspect of the verb changes to express the degree an action is completed. In English three aspects exist: Simple, progressive and perfect verbs are conjugated accordingly. Each aspect exists in the present, past and future tenses.

#### Simple Present:
- I cook
- You cook (singular)
- He/she/it cooks
- We cook
- You cook (plural)
- They cook

#### Progressive:
- I am cooking
- You are cooking (singular)
- He/she/it is cooking
- We are cooking
- You are cooking (plural)
- They are cooking

#### Perfect:
- I have cooked
- You have cooked (singular)
- He/she/it has cooked
- We have cooked
- You have cooked (plural)
- They have cooked

### How Verb Conjugation Affects Gender

Conjugation of English Verbs does not affect gender (males and females).

- He cooks.
- She cooks.

## Regular and Irregular Conjugations

Conjugation works differently in regular and irregular verbs.

### Regular Verbs:

Conjugation of regular verbs follow a regular pattern. Regular verbs add 'd', 'ed' or 'ied' to form the past tense or past participle.

**Example:**
- To soothe/soothed
- To jump/jumped
- To carry/carried

### Irregular Verbs:

An irregular verb is a verb that when conjugated does not follow a regular pattern in the past tense or past participle conjugations.

- To sing/sang
- To bring/brought
- To go/went

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Conjugate each of the following verbs:

1. To eat
2. To cook
3. To play
4. To be (simple present)
5. To cry (simple present)
6. To sleep (simple present)
7. To laugh (simple present)
8. Cooked (perfect)
9. Have been talking (perfect continuous)
10. Playing (present continuous)

# UNIT 27: Conventions of Spelling Using Acronyms and Contractions

## Acronyms and Initialisms

Abbreviations or Acronyms are very important, as they help in breaking down a long definition or title. One can use acronyms to memorize certain definitions that are very difficult to understand.

**Example:**
- WHO – World Health Organizations
- SLRA – Sierra Leone Road Authority

Acronyms and initialisms are abbreviations of multiple words using just their initial letters (or fragments of each word). Acronyms are distinguished by the fact that they are read aloud as a single word, while initials are spoken aloud as individual letters, rather than a single word.

### Examples:

- TSC – Teaching Service Commission
- MBSSE – Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education
- ECOWAS – Economic Community of West African States
- ATM – Automated Teller Machine
- UN – United Nations
- USA – United States of America
- UK – United Kingdom

However, there are some acronyms that have become so common in modern English that they are not capitalised at all. For example, **ASAP** which stands for "as soon as possible"; this is normally used in lower case because of the frequency in usage of **asap**.

There are also two initials that are always in lower case:
- **i.e** meaning "that is"
- **e.g** meaning "for example"

## Abbreviation of Words

An abbreviated version of words are using a shortened form of the word or words. There are two main types of abbreviations:

### 1. Formed by replacing missing letters with an apostrophe

This is by shortening a word or merging two words into one.

**Examples:**
- Do not – don't
- Cannot – can't
- Should not – shouldn't
- He is – he's

### 2. Formed by compressing a word

They do not have apostrophes.

**Examples:**
- Mister – Mr.
- Reverend – Rev.
- Doctor – Dr.
- Professor – Prof.

### Activity

**Activity 1:** Give the full meaning of these abbreviations:

1. UNICEF
2. UNFPA
3. AU
4. FBC
5. IMF

# UNIT 29: Sentences

## What is a Sentence?

A sentence is a group of words that express a complete thought or idea. Every sentence has two basic parts, a subject and a predicate.

A sentence begins with a capital letter and ends with a full stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark.

### Subject

Refers to the person or thing that is performing the action or is being talked about.

**Example:** Jombla is singing. (Here Jombla is the subject.)

### Predicate

Refers to the rest of the sentence which is after the subject and it always begins with a verb.

**Example:** Jombla is singing. (Here "is singing" is the predicate.)

**Note:** Both the subject and the predicate can consist of more than one word.

**The Subject:** This is the main noun or pronoun that tells whom or what the sentence is about.

**The Predicate:** This is the verb or verb phrase that expresses the action or state of being of the subject in the sentence.

### Examples:

| Simple Subject | Simple Predicate |
|----------------|------------------|
