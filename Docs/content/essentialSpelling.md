## About This List

The words covered represent **80–90%** of those found in most books and newspapers. Words have been divided into six Groups of increasing difficulty. Within each Group, words are arranged in small daily units and grouped by common spelling patterns so children are introduced to a pattern, practise it to secure it, and are then able to use it in their own writing.

| Group | Number of Words | Age |

| Group 1 | 396 | 7 |
| Group 2 | 456 | 8 |
| Group 3 | 544 | 9 |
| Group 4 | 576 | 10 |
