# UNIT 11: Time and Speed

**Duration:** 35 minutes

## Learning Outcome
Calculate speed, time and distance.

## What is Speed?

**Speed** is the rate of change of distance with respect to time.

**Formula:**
- Speed = Distance ÷ Time
- Time = Distance ÷ Speed
- Distance = Speed × Time

## Units of Measurement

- **Distance:** kilometers (km) or meters (m)
- **Time:** hours (h), minutes (min), seconds (sec)
- **Speed:** km/h or m/s

## Examples

### Example 1
A truck covers 224 km in 4 hours. Find its average speed.

**Solution:**
```
Average Speed = Distance ÷ Time
= 224 km ÷ 4 hours
= 56 km/hr
```

### Example 2
The speed of a train is 108 km/h. Find its speed in meters per second.

**Solution:**
```
108 km = 108 × 1000 = 108,000 m
1 hr = 60 × 60 = 3600 sec

Speed = 108,000 ÷ 3600 = 30 m/sec
```

### Example 3
How much time will be taken to cover 100 km at 10 km/hr?

**Solution:**
```
Time = Distance ÷ Speed
= 100 ÷ 10 = 10 hours
```

## Past NPSE Questions

1. A man walked for 8 hours from Freetown to Waterloo. He started at 10pm on Sunday. When did he arrive? **(NPSE 2010)**

2. A lorry travels 720 km in 4 hours. What is the average speed? **(NPSE 2010)**

# UNIT 12: Polygons

**Duration:** 35 minutes

## Learning Outcome
Calculate the missing angle inside a polygon.

## Definition
A **polygon** is any shape with 3 or more sides.

## Types of Polygons

|------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| Triangle | 3 | 1 | 180° |
| Quadrilateral | 4 | 2 | 360° |
| Pentagon | 5 | 3 | 540° |
| Hexagon | 6 | 4 | 720° |
| Heptagon | 7 | 5 | 900° |
| Octagon | 8 | 6 | 1080° |

## Formula
**Angle sum in polygon = 180 × (number of sides - 2)**

## Pentagon Angles

**Exterior angle:**
```
= 360° ÷ 5 = 72°
```

**Interior angle:**
```
= 180° - 72° = 108°
```

**Why?** Exterior + Interior = 180°

```

### Example 2
20 girls and 15 boys in a class.

**Ratio of girls to boys:**
```
Girls : Boys
20 : 15
÷5  ÷5
4 : 3
```

## Proportion

### Example 3
Are 15, 45, 40, 120 in proportion?

**Solution:**
```
15/45 = 1/3
40/120 = 1/3

Therefore: Yes, they are in proportion
```

## Word Problems

### Example 4
If 7m of cloth costs Le 1470, find the cost of 5m.

**Solution:**
```
Cost of 1m = 1470 ÷ 7 = Le 210
Cost of 5m = 210 × 5 = Le 1050
```

### Example 5
Adamma earns Le 3000 in 10 days. How much in 30 days?

**Solution:**
```
Earnings in 1 day = 3000 ÷ 10 = Le 300
Earnings in 30 days = 300 × 30 = Le 9000
```

## Past NPSE Questions

1. Express the ratio 450:900 in simplest form. **(NPSE 2012)**

## What is Percentage?

**Percentage** means "out of 100" represented by the symbol %.

### Example 1
What is 30% of 80?

**Solution:**
```
30% of 80 = 30/100 × 80
= 2400/100 = 24
```

### Example 2
In a class of 50 students, 40% are girls. Find the number of girls and boys.

**Solution:**
```
Girls = 40% of 50
= 40/100 × 50 = 20

Boys = 50 - 20 = 30
```

## Converting Percentage to Fraction

**Steps:**
1. Remove % sign
2. Divide by 100
3. Simplify

### Examples
- 16% = 16/100 = **4/25**
- 25% = 25/100 = **1/4**
- 75% = 75/100 = **3/4**

## Converting Percentage to Decimal

Move decimal point 2 places left.

- 23% = **0.23**
- 16% = **0.16**
- 7.5% = **0.075**

## Percentage of an Amount

### Example
Find 17% of $1700

**Solution:**
```
17% of 1700 = 17/100 × 1700
= $289
```

## Percentage Increase

**Formula:** (Increase ÷ Original) × 100%

### Example
Price of rice increased from $10 to $12.50. Find percentage increase.

**Solution:**
```
Increase = $12.50 - $10 = $2.50
Percentage = (2.50 ÷ 10) × 100% = 25%
```

## Past NPSE Questions

1. Express 3/10 as a percentage **(2013)**

2. A chicken laid 25 eggs. 13 were hens and 12 were cocks. What percentage were cocks? **(2015)**

# UNIT 23: Commerce - Profit and Loss

**Duration:** 70 minutes

## Learning Outcome
Understand how to solve problems with profit and loss.

## Definitions

### Profit
When **Selling Price > Cost Price**

**Formula:** Profit = SP - CP

### Loss
When **Cost Price > Selling Price**

**Formula:** Loss = CP - SP

## Examples

### Example 1
A chair bought at Le 25,000 is sold at Le 28,000. Find profit.

**Solution:**
```
Profit = SP - CP
= 28,000 - 25,000
= Le 3,000
```

### Example 2
Article bought at Le 9,000 sold at Le 8,200. Find profit or loss.

**Solution:**
```
CP > SP, so there is a loss
Loss = CP - SP
= 9,000 - 8,200
= Le 800
```

## Percentage Profit/Loss

**Formula:**
- Percentage Profit = (Profit ÷ CP) × 100%
- Percentage Loss = (Loss ÷ CP) × 100%

### Example 3
Book bought at Le 6,000 sold at Le 10,000. Find percentage profit.

**Solution:**
```
Profit = 10,000 - 6,000 = Le 4,000

Percentage = (4,000 ÷ 6,000) × 100%
= 66.67%
```

### Example 4
Bag cost Le 200,000 sold at Le 180,000. Find percentage loss.

**Solution:**
```
Loss = 200,000 - 180,000 = Le 20,000

Percentage = (20,000 ÷ 200,000) × 100%
= 10%
```

## Postal Rates

**Letters within Sierra Leone:**
- Up to 5g = Le 300
- 50g to 200g = Le 600

**Parcels:**
- Up to 100 kg = Le 2,000
- Less than 1000 kg = Le 1,000

## Quick Multiplication Methods

### Multiplying by 5
**Method:** Multiply by 10, then divide by 2

**Example:** 32 × 5
```
32 × 10 = 320
320 ÷ 2 = 160
```

### Multiplying by 50
**Method:** Multiply by 100, then divide by 2

**Example:** 16 × 50
```
16 × 100 = 1600
1600 ÷ 2 = 800
```

### Multiplying by 25
**Method:** Multiply by 100, then divide by 4

**Example:** 32 × 25
```
32 × 100 = 3200
3200 ÷ 4 = 800
```

## Divisibility Rules

A number is divisible by:

- **2** if last digit is even or 0
- **3** if sum of digits is divisible by 3
- **4** if last two digits form a number divisible by 4
- **5** if last digit is 5 or 0
- **6** if divisible by both 2 and 3
- **8** if last three digits are divisible by 8
- **9** if sum of digits is divisible by 9
- **10** if last digit is 0

### Example
Is 267 divisible by 3?

**Solution:**
```
Sum of digits: 2 + 6 + 7 = 15
15 is divisible by 3
Therefore: Yes, 267 is divisible by 3
```

# UNIT 28: Rates and Simple Interest

**Duration:** 35 minutes

## Learning Outcome
Solve problems involving rates and simple interest.

## Simple Interest

**Interest** is payment for saving or borrowing money.

**Formula:**
```
I = (P × T × R) ÷ 100
```

Where:
- **I** = Interest
- **P** = Principal (original amount)
- **T** = Time (in years)
- **R** = Rate (percentage per year)

## Other Formulas

```
P = (I × 100) ÷ (T × R)
T = (I × 100) ÷ (P × R)
R = (I × 100) ÷ (P × T)
```

## Examples

### Example 1
Find simple interest on Le 300 for 3 years at 4%

**Solution:**
```
I = (P × T × R) ÷ 100
= (300 × 3 × 4) ÷ 100
= 3600 ÷ 100
= Le 36
```

### Example 2
At what rate will Le 375 yield Le 75 interest in 5 years?

**Solution:**
```
R = (I × 100) ÷ (P × T)
= (75 × 100) ÷ (375 × 5)
= 7500 ÷ 1875
= 4%
```

### Example 3
In how many years will N420 gain N84 interest at 4%?

**Solution:**
```
T = (I × 100) ÷ (P × R)
= (84 × 100) ÷ (420 × 4)
= 8400 ÷ 1680
= 5 years
```

### Example 4
What principal will gain Le 75 in 5 years at 5%?

**Solution:**
```
P = (I × 100) ÷ (T × R)
= (75 × 100) ÷ (5 × 5)
= 7500 ÷ 25
= Le 300
```
