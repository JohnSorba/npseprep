# UNIT 5: Relation of Sets of Numbers Involving Addition

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Identify set relations involving numbers.

## Teacher's Guide

The operation is to add a constant difference to one term to get the next.

## Introduction

When given two or more set of numbers we can find the similarities or connections between different sets of numbers provided. Quantitative relation of sets of numbers can take different forms.

In this unit, we will learn about the relation of sets of numbers involving addition.

Any given set of numbers either have a relation or not.

We are going to look at some numbers to determine whether they are related or not by addition.

## Example 1

Now look at '2 and 4 and 6' by addition? Are they related? If they are related, what is the relation?

Are these numbers related?

**Yes**, these numbers are called even numbers and they go up by adding 2 each time. They are also in the two times tables.

## Example 2

Write 1, 4 and 7

What is the relation between these three numbers?

```
1    4    7
  +3   +3
```

These numbers go up by adding 3 to get to the next number.

## Example 3

**A = 1, 2, 3; B = 3, 5, 7; C = 4, 7, 10**

Which sets (A, B or C) contain numbers that are related?

Let us work through each set.

**In set A**, what number will you add to 1 give you 2?
- The answer is 1. So let us add 1 through out set A: 1 + 1 = 2, 2 + 1 = 3, numbers are related by adding 1.

**In set B**, what number will you add to 3 to give you 5?
- The answer is 2.
- B: 3 + 2 = 5, 5 + 2 = 7, therefore numbers in set B are related by the adding 2 to get the next term.

**In set C**, what number will you add to 4 to give you 7?
- The answer is 3. So set C: 4 + 3 = 7, 7 + 3 = 10, therefore numbers in Set C (4, 7 and 10) are related by adding three to get the next term.

The examples we just worked out show that some sets of numbers are related by addition. Ex. A, B and C are related by addition.

## Exercise 1

Write down the relationships between these set of numbers.

1. A = 10, 20, 30, ………… , …..……..
2. B = 4, 7, 10, ………… , …………….
3. C = 13, 16, 19, …………. , ………….
4. D = 1, 2, 3; …………. , ………….
5. E = 3, 5, 7; …………. , ………….

6. Find the next two terms.
   - a. A = 4, 9 and 14, ………….. …………….
   - b. B = 2, 5 and 8 ………….. …………….
   - c. C = 45, 50 and 55 ………….. …………….

# UNIT 6: Relations of Sets of Numbers Involving Subtraction

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: identify the relation of sets of numbers involving subtraction.

## Teacher's Guide

Teacher to carefully review the operations before the lesson. The operation involved is subtracting a constant number from one term to get to the next term.

## Example 1

Consider the following operations, find out if they are related and how they are related:

**Set A:** 10, 8, 6

There is a relation between the numbers in set A; the relation between 10 and 8 is the subtraction of 2.

```
10 - 2 = 8
8 - 2 = 6
```

**Set B:** 8, 5, 2

Considering set 'B', it can be agreed that there is a relation between the set of numbers. (the relation between '8 and 5' and '5 and 2' is the subtraction of 3)

```
8 - 3 = 5
5 - 3 = 2
```

**Set C:** 10, 6, 4

In set C, the numbers are not related with a constant number by subtraction.

The example we just worked out show that while some set of numbers are related by subtraction (A and B), others are not related by subtraction (C).

## Example 2

a. A = 30, 20, 10
b. B = 12, 8, 4
c. C = 9, 6, 3

How are the numbers in set A to C related?

**Solution:**

a. The set A's numbers are related by the subtraction of 10.
b. Set B's numbers are related by subtraction of four (4).
c. Set C's numbers are related by the subtraction of 3.

## Exercise 1

1. Find the relation by subtraction between the following numbers.
   - a. A = 14, 9, 4
   - b. B = 12, 8, 4
   - c. C = 23, 20, 17

2. Are the following sets related or unrelated by subtraction?
   - a. 15, 10, 5
   - b. 6, 4, 2

3. Find the missing number in the following related numbers.
   - 144, 132, ?, 108, 96
   - (a) 102
   - (b) 105
   - (c) 115
   - (d) 120
   - (e) 130

# UNIT 7: Relations of Sets of Numbers Involving Multiplication

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Identify the relation between a set of numbers involving multiplication.

## Teacher's Guide

The operation is to multiply one term by a constant number to get to the next term.

## Introduction

Look at this set of numbers:

**1, 2, 4, 8**

In this set of numbers the common multiplier is 2. So, you multiple each term by 2 to get the next term. Therefore, to get the next term after last number 8 you multiple 8 × 2 = 16 and also multiple 16 × 2 = 32.

## Example

Study the diagram below and determine whether the number in each set are related or not by multiplication.

If they are related, how are they related?

**Set A:** 3, 6

There is a relation between the numbers in set A: 3 × 2 = 6.

**Set B:** 1, 3, 9

Considering set B: 1 × 3 = 3, 3 × 3 = 9, Yes, they are related by multiplying by 3

**Set C:** 3, 6, 12

In set C the numbers are related by multiplying each term by 2 to next to the number.

## Examples:

a. A = 1, 4, 16
b. B = 1, 3, 9
c. C = 3, 6, 12

Group these sets of numbers into those that are related by subtraction and those unrelated by multiplication.

**Note:** Teacher - Walk around the room, check pupils work and have a discussion with them and assist where necessary.

How are the numbers in set A and C related? Raise your hand to answer.

**Answer:** The set A's numbers are related by multiplying through with 4 and set C's numbers are related by multiplying through with 2.

How are the numbers in set B related?

Numbers in set B are related by multiplying by 3

**Answer:** We multiplied 1 by 3 to give us 3, then we multiplied 3 by 3, to gives us 9.

## Exercise 1

Find the relation by multiplying between the following numbers and then find the next 2 terms.

a. A = 4, 8, 16, ………………., ………………
b. B = 2, 10, 50………………., ………………
c. C = 6, 12, 24………………., ………………

# UNIT 8: Relations of Sets of Numbers Involving Division

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Identify the relationship between set of numbers involving division.

## Teacher's Guide

Teacher to understand that each term is divided by a constant number to get to the next term.

Look at this sequence:

**48, 24, 12**

## Introduction

Any given set of numbers either have a relation or doesn't have a relation.

We are going to look at some numbers to determine whether they are related or not by division.

Study the diagram below and determine whether the number in each set are related or not by division.

If they are related, how are they related?

**Set A:** 12, 6, 3

The relation between 12, 6 and 3: divided each time by 2.

```
12 ÷ 2 = 6
6 ÷ 2 = 3
```

**Set B:** 9, 3, 1

Considering set B: the relation between 9, 3 and 1: divided by 3 to get the next number.

```
9 ÷ 3 = 3
3 ÷ 3 = 1
```

**Set C:** 32, 8, 4

The numbers are not related by division. Each subsequent number is not the result of dividing the prior number by a particular number. For example, 32 were divided by 4 to get 8. So, for the set of numbers to be related, 8 would also need to be divided by 4, which would give us 2 and not 4.

To conclude: set (A and B), others are also not related by division (C).

## Exercise 1

Find the relation between the following numbers:

1. A = 16, 8, 4
2. B = 50, 10, 2
3. C = 16, 8, 2

Pupils to write their answers in their books and work individually.

## Recap

Are the following sets related or unrelated by division?

a. 16, 4, 1 **(Answer: related)**
b. 36, 6, 1 **(Answer: unrelated)**

How do you know the set of numbers in B are unrelated by division?

**Example answer:** There is no common number to divide 24 to get 6 and 6 to get 1, you divide 24 by 4 = 6 but 6 divided by 4 is not 1.

In this set of numbers, the relationship between each term to get next number is dividing by 2 to get the next term. So, to get the next term after 12 we divide 12 ÷ 2 = 6 and also divide 6 ÷ 2 = 3, so the missing number are 6 and 3.

**Note:** Always study the connection or relation between the numbers to find or get a constant or common difference.

# UNIT 9: Relations of Sets of Numbers Involving the Four (4) Operations

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Identify the relation between two sets of numbers involving the four operations.

## Teacher's Guide

There are always two sets of ordered pairs of numbers. Teacher should relate first numbers of the ordered pairs and the second numbers of the ordered pairs to carefully note the operation, which could be addition, subtraction, multiplication or division.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we will be making use of ordered pairs of numbers. Ordered pairs fall within set rules and are written in this form **(x, y)**.

X is the first numbers in the bracket and Y is the second numbers in the brackets.

## Example 1

Draw the example below:

**A(3, 4) B(6, 3)**

Rule: x × 2, y - 1

The first number is the x value of the first pair of numbers in A should always be related to the first number or x value of the second pair of numbers in B.

So, in the example above, 3 is related to 6 by multiplying 3 by 2. (3 × 2 = 6)

Also the second number, the Y value of the first pair of numbers in A should always be related to the second number, or Y value, of the second pair of numbers in B.

In the example above, 4 is related to 3 by subtracting 1 from 4.

## Example 2

Write A (4, 6) and B (6, 2).

Consider these new sets of ordered pair of numbers: A (4, 6) and B (6, 2).

What rule do these pairs of numbers obey?

Point to the X value of set A and B (4 and 6). What is the relation between these two numbers?

**Example answers:** 4 + 2 = 6, therefore the relation is adding 2.

The Y values of set A and B (6 and 2) shows there is a relation between these two numbers.

There are two ways to this:
- 6 ÷ 3 = 2
- 6 – 4 = 2

Therefore, the relation in the Y values can either be dividing by 3 or subtracting 4.

## Example 3

Let us make 2 ordered pair of numbers and numbers between 1 and 10.

Write (2, 7) and (3, 5).

Give the relation between these ordered pairs.

**Answer:** x: x + 1, y: y – 2.

With the X value 1 was added to 2 to arrive at 3 (2 + 1 = 3). With the Y values 2 was subtracted from 7 to arrive at 5 (7 - 2 = 5).

The relation between the ordered pairs (2, 7) and (3, 5) is x + 1, y - 2.

## Exercise

1. Find the rule for the following ordered pairs of numbers:
   - a. A = (1, 4) and (4, 12)
   - b. B = (5, 9) and (4, 3)

2. Using any numbers from and including 1 to 5, write a set of ordered pairs using the rule x + 2, y × 2

3. What is the rule for the following ordered pairs: (3, 5) (5, 10)? Raise your hand to answer.

4. Have pupils to exchange their exercise books and check their work as you read the answer aloud

## Recap

1. We looked at how to identify and write ordered pairs that follow a rule involving the four operations.
2. We also found out that some ordered pairs can follow more than one rule.
3. Ordered pairs are written in the form (x, y)
4. The x value can have a different rule from the y value.

# UNIT 20: Patterns with Continuous Multiplication

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Do simple operations that involve multiplication.

## Teacher's Guide

Teacher should note that we multiply factors to get products and when the product is given, we divide to get the factor.

## Sample

```
3 × 2 × 1 = 6     4 × 15 × 3 = 180     7 × 4 × 5 = 140
```

## Exercise 1

Find the missing numbers in the following operations

- (A) 0
- (B) 1
- (C) 2
- (D) 3
- (E) 4

**Q2)** Find the missing number
- (A) 128
- (B) 36
- (C) 0
- (D) 1
- (E) 2

## Example 2

From the example, it is observed that the fourth number is obtained by multiplying together the other three numbers.

In (i) 2 × 3 × 1 = 6, which is the fourth number.

In (ii) 4 × 2 × 5 = 40, which is the fourth number.

In (iii) 7 × 3 × 5 = 105, which is the fourth number.

Now apply this rule to the following diagrams to find the missing number.

In (i) 2 × 4 × 3 = 24. Therefore 24 goes into the box as the fourth number.

In (ii) 3 × 2 × ? = 30, 6 × ? = 30. The number to be multiplied by 6 to give you 30 is 5. Therefore 5 goes into the box.

## Patterns Involving Sequential Multiplication

### Example 3

```
2 × 2 = 4      3 × 2 = 6      5 × 2 = 10
4 × 2 = 8      6 × 2 = 12     10 × 2 = 20
8 × 2 = 16     12 × 2 = 24    20 × 2 = 40
```

In the above example, 2 is used as a constant number to multiply. Now use the same method to find the unknown.

# UNIT 30: Roman Numbers

## Learning Outcome

Pupils will be able to: Identify and do simple calculations with Roman numbers.

## Teacher's Guide

Teacher should draw a chart of Roman numbers to explain the symbols represented by the numbers for pupils to understand.

## Introduction

The figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... are called Arabic numbers. The basic Roman numbers are:

| Arabic | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 10 | 100 | 500 | 1000 |
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|----|-----|-----|------|
| Roman  | I | II | III | IV | V | X | C | D | M |

### Rules for Roman Numbers

- To write six, put one I after the five V which gives VI
- One I in front of any number is a subtraction
- Example: VI means 5 + 1 = 6, VII = 5 + 2 = 7 and so on
- Ten is written as X
- To write nine (9), put 1 before ten(X) which means 10 – 1 = 9 (IX)
- To write eleven, put one after the ten X i.e XI (10 + 1 = 11)
- Fifteen is X + V = 15 (XV)
- Hundred is C
- Ninety is 100 – 10 = 90 (XC) and so on
