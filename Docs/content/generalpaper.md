# HOME ECONOMICS

## Unit 1: Introduction to Home Economics

### Definition
Home Economics is a field of study that deals with the relationship between individuals, families, community and the environment in which they live.

### Branches of Home Economics

Home Economics is divided into three (3) main branches:

1. **Food and Nutrition**
2. **Clothing and Textile**
3. **Home Management**

### Food and Nutrition

**Food** is anything solid or liquid which when taken into the body provides energy and heat, promotes growth, protects and regulates body processes.

**Nutrition** is the study of food, the food value it contains and the ways in which it is used in the body.

### Classes of Food (Nutrients in Balanced Diet)

Food can be divided into six (6) groups:

1. **Carbohydrate** - e.g. maize, yam, garri, potatoes and millet
2. **Protein** - from beans, dairy, eggs, soy products and legumes
3. **Vitamins** - from fruits and vegetables
4. **Mineral Salts** - from animal and vegetable sources
5. **Fat and Oil** - from fish and avocado
6. **Water**

### Reasons for Eating Food

1. To get energy
2. To grow
3. To protect us from diseases and germs
4. To nourish our body
5. To replace our worn out tissues
6. To be healthy
7. To fight against anti-bodies
8. To strengthen our bones and teeth

### Methods of Cooking Food

There are two (2) main methods of cooking food:

1. **Dry Method Cooking** - Heat is applied directly to the food at a high temperature
   - Examples: baking, roasting, grilling and toasting

2. **Wet Method Cooking** - Heat is applied to the food through liquid or water
   - Examples: Par-boiling (partial boiling), deep frying, shallow frying, steaming, and boiling

### Detailed Food Classes

#### Carbohydrates
Includes sugar or starchy foods e.g. Yam, cassava, sweet potato rice, foo-foo and sugarcane.

#### Proteins
Build and repair worn out body tissues e.g. meat, fish beans, milk, cheese, nuts, seed etc.

#### Fat and Oils
Provide the body with heat and energy especially during cold weather. Examples include margarine, butter, palm oil, cooking oil, groundnut oil, seed oil, coconut oil, olive oil etc.

#### Vitamins
Chemical substances found in food that protect the body from diseases and germs. Examples: pear, mango, oranges and pawpaw.

#### Mineral Salt
Helps in the maintenance of body tissue, muscles and bones. It also prevents the body from anaemia. Examples include green leaves, vegetables such as leaves, garden eggs, carrots, lettuce and sea food and iodized salt.

#### Water
Necessary for proper functioning of the body and ensuring healthy skin. It helps in digestion, excretion, urination, tear formation and absorption. A major portion of blood is water. Examples include fresh water, vegetables, fruits such as pineapple, orange, and rose apple.

## Unit 2: The Importance of the Classes of Food

### Food Groups

The six (6) classes of food (nutrients) can be grouped into three (3):

1. **Energy-giving food** - Carbohydrates, fats and oils, and roughages (water)
2. **Body-building food** - Proteins
3. **Protective food** - Vitamins, minerals and roughages

### Balanced Diet/Complete Diet

A balanced or complete diet is a diet that contains all the classes of food nutrients (food values) in their correct amount.

**Percentage of food value in a balance diet:**
- Carbohydrate: 55%
- Proteins: 20%
- Fat and oil: 15%
- Water, mineral & Vitamins: 10%
- **Total: 100%**

### Effects of Not Eating a Balanced Diet

#### Children
They need all the major foods in a balanced diet.

#### Old People
The majority of elderly people need very little change to the diet they have been eating throughout their adult lives but fats and sugar should be reduced.

#### Very Active Workers
People in this group should be given meals that provide them with sufficient energy.

#### Light Workers
Should not be given heavy diets. They should eat light food so that there will not be an increase in their weight. For example they should eat small amounts of cooked rice, yoghurt, tomatoes, eggs, and fresh fruits.

#### Pregnant and Nursing Mothers
Their diet should provide sufficient nutrients to meet the needs of the growing fetus or young baby. Iron is necessary for the red blood cells of the mother and the body for oxygen to produce energy. Calcium, fluoride, vitamin B complex, vitamin A and B are also good.

### Life Cycle of the Malaria Parasite

Involves two hosts: the female anopheles mosquito and man.

**Cause of Malaria:**

During sucking of human blood, the female anopheles mosquito injects sporozoites into the human host. Sporozoites infect liver cells. In the liver they grow into schizonts. They grow further and come out of the liver into the blood as merozoites ready to attack the person with malaria. The malaria parasite in the blood stream causes shivering, high temperature and destruction of the red blood cells.

**Life Cycle:** Sporozoites (from mosquito to the liver of man) → Schizonts (in the liver of man) → merozoites (enter the bloodstream from the liver) → Mosquito sucks the mosquito parasites from malaria infected person again.

- Has a definite shape
- Has definite volume
- Particles are closely packed together
- Examples: stones, books, ruler

#### Properties of Liquid:
- Has definite volume
- Can flow/Has big inter-particle spaces
- Takes the shape of the container in which it is put
- Has no definite shape
- Examples: water, kerosene, soft drink

- Examples: sugar, salt

**Solvent:** A liquid or gas that can dissolve a solid and another liquid
- Examples: Turpentine, acetone, ethanol, water (Water is a universal solvent)

**Solution:** A uniform mixture of a solute and a solvent
- Example: salt in water gives a saline solution, Sugar in water gives a sugar solution

### Change of State of Matter

Depending on the temperature and pressure, matter may change from one state to another.

6. **Deposition** - A change from gas directly to solid (Without passing through the liquid state)

### Light and Colours

Human eyes and brain together translate light into colours. Light receptors within the eyes transmit messages to the brain which produces familiar sensation of colours.

**Colours:** Visible light with a specific wave length. Black and white are not colours because they do not have specific wavelengths.

**Wavelength:** The distance covered by a wave in one complete cycle.

**Primary colours of light:** Red, Green and Blue

- White light contains all the wavelengths of visible light
- Black is the absence of visible light
- Mixing primary colours in different proportions can make all the colours of the light we see

### Separation (or dispersion) of the colours of light

A (triangular) prism can be used to separate white light into different colours of light.

The use of a prism to separate white light into the different colours of the rainbow (spectrum) is called dispersion of light.

**The rainbow colours:** Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo and Violet (ROYGBIV)

**Opaque Object:** One that does not let light to go through it, instead it reflects or absorb the light that strikes on it.
