#### Sample 1: *How I Spent My Last Holiday*

I spent my last holiday at my grandmother’s village, which is located far away from the busy city. The journey was long, but I enjoyed the fresh air and beautiful scenery along the road.

During my stay, I helped my grandmother with household chores such as fetching water, sweeping the compound, and preparing meals. In the evenings, she told us stories about her childhood, which were both interesting and educational.

The holiday taught me the importance of family, hard work, and respect for elders. I returned home refreshed and ready for school.

**Explanation:** This composition has a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, and it uses simple past tense appropriately.

#### Sample 2: *A Memorable Day in My Life*

One of the most memorable days in my life was the day I won a prize in my school’s inter-house sports competition. I felt proud and excited.

The event took place on a sunny morning. Pupils gathered on the field while teachers encouraged us. When my race began, I ran with all my strength and finished first.

That day remains special to me because it taught me confidence and determination.
